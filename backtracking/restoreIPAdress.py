No.93
Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be obtained from s.
You can return them in any order.
A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers, each integer is between 0 and 255,
separated by single dots and cannot have leading zeros.
For example, "0.1.2.201" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses and "0.011.255.245", "192.168.1.312"
and "192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.

Given s = '2552551135'

       2         25   255   2552 -> this node get pruned cuz its more than three digits, so it wouldn't be valid

   5   52 525  5  52

         this node get pruned cuz its greater than 255
