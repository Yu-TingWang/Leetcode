No.740. Delete and Earn
Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
In each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points.
After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.
You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.
